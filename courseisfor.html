                I can’t put in the effort for you and I can’t guarantee that you’ll get a job in one of these leagues just by taking the course. But if you do the work and engage with the community throughout the 8 weeks, 
                <span class="stack-deck">you’ll definitely stack the deck in your favour.</span>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                And, by joining the course, you’ll be within a network that can help 
                <span class="stack-deck">accelerate your skills and career in the sector. </span>
                <br/>

                <strong>
                    ❌ But, having said all that -  this course isn&#x27;t for you if:

                <span class="not4u1">You’re taking the course just to put more letters after your name.</span>
                 This isn’t a passive &quot;add letters to my resume&quot; programme. You&#x27;ll be expected to read research, complete assignments, apply this knowledge in your current role and complete both a capstone project and final exam to earn the certification.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                -&gt; 
                <span class="not4u1">You’re not willing to buy into the philosophy of a rising tide lifts all boats.</span>
                 This isn’t a solo endeavour. The power of learning from others in the community cannot be understated and if you’re not prepared to engage with other coaches to 
                <em>enhance the group</em>
                , then this course probably isn’t for you.
                <br/>

                -&gt; 
                <span class="not4u1">You’re looking for a magic bullet to work in the top US sports leagues.</span>
                <span class="red-letters"></span>
                It doesn’t work like that. If you’re not prepared to put in the effort and properly engage in both the learning and the application of the material, this course isn’t for you.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                ✅ However, this course is for you if:
                <br/>
                -&gt; You are excited to engage with the course properly, complete all your assignments, apply your learnings in the real world and engage with your peers. Above all, if you’re passionate about developing your skills, then 
                <em>this course is for you and you&#x27;ll be a valuable member of the community.</em>
