            <p class="paragraph-text">
                <strong>The APCC program condenses over 10 years of coaching experience at the highest level of sport into an immersive, 4-week live online course.</strong>
                <br/>
                Throughout my journey I’ve focused on two main areas which I feel are key to succeeding as a coach - 
                <span class="area1">increasing theoretical knowledge about the subject</span>
                 and 
                <span class="area2">understanding how to apply that knowledge practically.</span>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Over the past decade, I’ve taken so many courses that either focus on the classroom or the coaching. You’re either overwhelmed with theory, with no application. Or told how to apply something with no background theory.

                The bridge between science and application.
