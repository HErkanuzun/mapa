                    Being an effective coach is not easy.
                    <br/>
                </span>
                <br/>
                Whether you’re a strength coach, athletic trainer or physical therapist, we all face the same challenges; applying theoretical science, coaching athletes and clients in the real world and trying to filter through the copious volumes of information and noise to figure out what’s actually important.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                In the modern world, we all have access to unprecedented amounts of information but what do you do with all that? 
                <em>How can you filter it down and draw out what’s actually useful?</em>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                And it’s not just about knowing the theory and the science. To be an effective coach you need to be able to 
                <span class="span1">apply that in practice</span>
                , 
                <span class="span2">understand human behaviour</span>
                 and 
                <span class="span3">inspire performance from your athletes</span>
                . 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <em>
                    Not an easy feat. 
                    <br/>
                </em>
                <br/>
                With a seemingly endless list of courses, certifications, mentorships, and resources available, it can be difficult to know where to start..
                <br/>
                <br/>
                That&#x27;s where 
                <span class="span-apc">the APCC program</span>
                 can help.
