                My name’s 
                <strong>Dr. Ramsey Nijem</strong>
                <span></span>
                (Ram for short) and I’ve been coaching for over 10 years.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                After completing my Masters degree at the age of 22, I was recruited into the NBA by the Sacramento Kings in 2014 working as the assistant strength and conditioning coach. Two years later, at the age of 25, I was promoted to the role of Head S&amp;C and in the process became 
                <span class="span-youngest">the youngest Head S&amp;C Coach in NBA history.</span>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                At the age of 27 I completed my doctorate and soon after that, I was poached by the University of Kansas Men&#x27;s Basketball programme to join their coaching staff as the Director of Sport Performance. Within the first year, we were the number one team in the country and last year 
                <span class="span-youngest">we won the National Championship.</span>
                <br/>
            </p>
            <img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/637c53a8eb2c7a383d9cd1c6/639b435f5b0c7d8136900552_Screenshot%202022-12-15%20at%2015.53.10.png" alt="" class="trophy-img"/>
            <p class="paragraph-text white">
                Of course, I don’t claim to be the reason behind Kansas’ success, nor do I claim to be inherently special as the youngest S&amp;C coach in NBA history - timing and hard work played a big role in that. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                But I can confidently claim that all these examples have provided me with 
                <span class="span-youngest">a wealth of experience and knowledge</span>
                 that I know other coaches could benefit from and I’ve tried to bring all these learnings together in this course to help other coaches reach their potential.
